          Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), global goals to tackle the
          issues of poverty, education, employment, hunger, healthcare, clean
          water, and sustainable cities, among others, to protect the planet,
          have been trending since 2015 when the United Nations embraced them.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, for Educationist, Statesman, Visionary, and Social
          entrepreneur Shri. Amrishbhai Patel, these have been an intrinsic part
          of his vision much before he even set foot in the public domain.
          Little surprise, considering he has an imposing legacy to emulate - he
          is a descendant of the tall leader and staunch freedom fighter, Shri.
          Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having spent his growing up years in Shirpur, a drought-prone and
          rather underdeveloped taluka in the Dhule district, Maharashtra, where
          his father ran a business, Shri. Amrishbhai Patel was well acquainted
          with the problems of his hometown. Always inclined towards environment
          conservation and social work, even as a young boy, he began by
          informally educating his fellow citizens of Shirpur about the
          importance of water preservation and hygiene. His passion towards the
          community and popular demand led him to become the co-opted member of
          the Shirpur Nagarpalika in the early 70s - a post he continued in for
          an uninterrupted 18 years. He also served as the Cabinet Education
          Minister from 2002 to 2004.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shri. Amrishbhai always knew that he had to give back to the people of
          his village now that he had the power to bring about a change. This
          staunch determination to transform his village helped him devise a
          multipronged approach to bring about the changes - to tackle the water
          scarcity in the village, provide quality education and employment to
          the people in the village, provide the best healthcare, setting up
          avenues for entertainment, besides making it a green and clean
          destination.

            Water management: Transformation from â€˜crisis to abundanceâ€™ for
            sustainable development
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Shirpur (Pattern) Model: Supporting and strengthening the
            participation of local communities in improving water management
          </p>
          <p>
            Water is at the very core of sustainable development, critical to
            the survival of people on our planet. The â€˜Shirpur Patternâ€™ of
            improvement included a holistic development and progress of the city
            by addressing this very fundamental element of nature. It all
            started with proper water management, which later translated into
            the overall prosperity of the villages of Shirpur.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, the model stands as a testimony of rural growth and
            revolution. Shri. Amrishbhai Patel was clear in his mind - that a
            driven focus on irrigation, water harvesting, and education was
            needed to alleviate the village of its neglected state. He
            introduced the â€˜Shirpur Patternâ€™ of irrigation - the idea was to
            stop the water from draining into the river. This meant constructing
            check dams on every stream, despite its size, to facilitate maximum
            storage and expansion of water channels. He roped in expert Dr.
            Suresh Khanapur to execute the project that began way back in 2004.
          </p>
          <p>
            Initially, a 30 sq. km area was taken for conservation of water and,
            ninetyseven check dams were erected in the area. The outcome was not
            a single drop of water escaped into the river, and eventually,
            10,000 hectares of land became conducive to irrigation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The projectâ€™s outcome was nothing short of magic - not only did it
            assure sustainable irrigation in the drought-prone areas, but the
            farmers also got a new lease of life, experiencing cropping three
            times a year. The exodus to cities by disheartened farmers, which
            was rampant, also came down drastically.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Shirpur Pattern also brought continuous water supply to homes
            and industries, bringing a paradigm shift in the entire economy and
            ecosystem of the villages.
          </p>
          <p>
            In just ten years, the water table has risen to forty metres, dams
            are full, and there is irrigation all year round. The farmers are
            flourishing because the village is flush with abundant water. The
            value of land has appreciated tremendously.

          </p>
          <p>
            Another vital agenda in Shri. Amrishbhai Patelâ€™s long-term vision
            was to generate education opportunities for the villages' children.
            He firmly believes that quality education that creates employment
            prospects for students is the best kind of training. Mere rote
            learning and a meaningless certificate is of no use. He was keen on
            bringing in the sense of accountability amongst teachers and school
            administrators. So, he borrowed money from his father and, in 1990,
            set up the Shirpur Education Society. He aimed to instil an
            environment that would encourage the students to learn. With the
            money he received, Shri. Amrishbhai Patel introduced seventeen
            pre-primary schools, eight K-12 schools, seven ashram schools, and
            four colleges in Shirpur, immediately creating an academic
            environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            â€œIn a city with a population of 75,000 people, today 35,000 are
            studying in schools and colleges in Shirpur. So, 50% of the
            population is studying and we have not witnessed a single dropout.
            Only good education can empower people. Human resource is one of the
            biggest strengths of our country and they need to be educated - they
            should get employment opportunities anywhere in India. This is the
            only way to eradicate poverty.
          </p>
          <p>
            The same vision is reflected in SVKMâ€™s NMIMS, of which Shri.
            Amrishbhai Patel is the Chancellor. His keen foresight has helped in
            the unparalleled success of the now Deemed-to-be-University.

            faculty and infrastructure and unique teaching and learning methods

            Management, Entrepreneurship, Design, Hospitality Management,
            Liberal Arts, Performing Arts and Agricultural Science, to name a
            few.
          </p>
          <p>
            SVKMâ€™s NMIMS has also spread its wings with several state-of-the-art
            campuses in Shirpur, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Indore, Navi Mumbai,
            Chandigarh, and Dhule. Here too, the emphasis is on the
            employability of all its students, and the impeccable placement
            records of NMIMS is a vindication of its approach. This vision has
            now been globally recognised, and NMIMS Mumbai, Profile of Shri.

            people, giving them security and improving the overall quality of
            their life. Being the thought leader that he is, Shri. Amrishbhai
            Patel recognised the importance of generating employment
            opportunities for the inhabitants of Shirpur. Now without any water
            shortage, it was easier to set up factories. He set up a spinning
            mill - the largest in Maharashtra - to leverage the cotton that
            grows on 1,50,000 acres of land in the village. A textile mill
            followed, plus a co-operative yarn factory, a dyeing, and a garment
            factory. Six thousand local people have found jobs because of this
            initiative. The workforce at the garment factory primarily includes
            destitute, widowed, abandoned, and needy women. They are trained to
            work at the factory at a local training centre.

            Healthcare: Access to medical infrastructure and bridging the divide

            Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being No village can be
            self-sustained without proper medical infrastructure. To this end,
            Shri. Amrishbhai Patel facilitated the building of a super
            speciality hospital in the village. The 700-bed advanced and modern
            hospital with world-class amenities is a saviour for the locals for
            being reasonably priced.

            If Shirpur, once a derelict village, is a haven and a symbol of
            prosperity today, all the credit must go to the perseverance,
            determination and keen perceptiveness and insight of Shri.
            Amrishbhai Patel. He is a philanthropist with a difference. He is
            not only a leader but is involved at the grassroots level - readily
            approachable, communicating with the people first hand and being
            personally involved in their real problems. A true solution seeker,
            a mover and shaker who walks the talk.
          </p>
          <p>
            Presently, Shirpur, a thriving centre of commerce and education,
            boasts of 24- hour water supply in every household, immaculate
            concrete streets, a fullfledged gym, parks for recreation and
            entertainment, greenery (the neem trees planted in the village
            amount to 1,50,000 in number) - an idyllic village, straight out of
            a picture postcard, with happy and content people. It is not just a
            job completed for Shri. Amrishbhai Patel - he works from his heart
            and believes that community is the extension of the self.

            The famous lines by Robert Frost - The woods are lovely, dark, and
            deep, But I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep,
            and miles to go before I sleep - summarises perfectly the mission
            that Shri. Amrishbhai Patel has assigned himself: To make the world
            a better place.

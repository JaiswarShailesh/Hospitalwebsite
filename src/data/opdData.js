      "At SVKM’s Tapanbhai Mukeshbhai Patel Memorial Hospital, we strive to make your healthcare journey as smooth as possible, starting from the very first step. Our appointment booking and registration system is designed to reduce waiting time and offer flexibility to patients. You can schedule an appointment easily through our online booking portal, by calling our telephone helpline, or by visiting the hospital reception directly. During registration, our staff ensures that your details are recorded accurately so that doctors have complete medical information when you visit. For new patients, a unique hospital ID is created, while returning patients benefit from well-maintained records that support continuity of care. This process allows us to provide faster, personalized, and more reliable services to everyone.",

      "We understand that financial flexibility is as important as medical care. To ensure a smooth experience, the hospital offers a variety of secure and convenient payment methods. Patients can make payments in cash at the billing counter, use debit or credit cards from all major banks, or complete transactions through UPI and net banking. For patients covered under insurance or TPA, we provide cashless facilities where treatment charges are directly settled with the insurer, and for employees of partner organizations, corporate billing options are available. Every transaction is handled by our dedicated billing department with full transparency and clarity, and patients are provided with detailed invoices. Our focus is on minimizing financial stress so that patients and their families can concentrate fully on recovery.",
